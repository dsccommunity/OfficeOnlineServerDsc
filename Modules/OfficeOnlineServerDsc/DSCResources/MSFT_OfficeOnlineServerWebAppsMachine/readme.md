**Description**

The OfficeOnlineServerWebAppsMachine resource is used to instruct the server to join
an existing Office Web Apps 2013 or Office Online Server 2016 farm. Specify the name
of the first server (which would have run the OfficeOnlineServerWebAppsFarm resource)
and it will join on that server when this resource is run.
