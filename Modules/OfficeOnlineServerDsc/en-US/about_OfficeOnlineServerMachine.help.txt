    OfficeOnlineServerMachine

# Description
    
    The OfficeOnlineServerMachine resource is used to instruct the server to join
    an existing Office Web Apps 2013 or Office Online Server 2016 farm. Specify the name
    of the first server (which would have run the OfficeOnlineServerFarm resource)
    and it will join on that server when this resource is run.
    
.PARAMETER Ensure
    Write - String
    Allowed values: Present, Absent
    Ensure Present or Absent

.PARAMETER Roles
    Write - String
    Specifies one or more server roles, separated by commas, to assign to the new server. If no roles are specified, then the server is assigned all roles.

.PARAMETER MachineToJoin
    Key - String
    Specifies the name of any server that is already a member of the Office Web Apps Server farm.


.EXAMPLE
    This example shows how to join a machine to an Office Web Apps farm. This
    shows that the new server will use all roles (it is not recommended to 
    split roles out to dedicated servers for Office Online Server farms of 
    less than 50 servers).
