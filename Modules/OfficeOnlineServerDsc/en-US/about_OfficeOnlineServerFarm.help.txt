.NAME
    OfficeOnlineServerFarm

# Description
    
    The OfficeOnlineServerFarm resource is used to create a new farm for either
    Office Web Apps 2013 or Office Online Server 2016. It requries that the binaries
    have already been installed, but when this is run it will establish a new farm. This
    means that this resource only needs to be used on the first server in a deployment,
    all other servers should use the OfficeOnlineServerMachine resource to join
    the farm.

.PARAMETER SSLOffloaded

When SSLOffloaded is enabled, web applications are bound to port 80 (HTTP) on the local server. However, HTML that references other resources, such as CSS or images, uses HTTPS URLs for those references.

.PARAMETER TranslationEnabled
    Write - Boolean
    Enables support for automatic document translation using Microsoft Translator, an online service that translates text between languages. The translated file is shown in the Word Web App. Because Microsoft Translator is an online service, you must enable server-to-web communication directly or by using a proxy that you specify by using the Proxy parameter.

Typically you will not use this parameter unless you have negotiated with Microsoft Translator for additional services and they have provided you with a private application ID.

.EXAMPLE
    This example shows how to create a basic web apps farm. There are many more options
    that can be configured on this resource, but this minimum configuration will deploy
    a farm that has editing enabled.


    Configuration Example 
    {
        param()

        Import-DscResource -ModuleName OfficeOnlineServerDsc

        OfficeOnlineServerFarm LocalFarm
        {
            InternalURL    = "https://officeonline.contoso.com"
            EditingEnabled = $true
        }
    }
